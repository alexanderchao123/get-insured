# Get-Insured

Get-Insured is a single page application built on React for potential customers to fill out a form with zip code, currently insured, age parameters to provide insurance rates. The application was styled with Bootstrap 3.1.1 and vanilla CSS.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alexanderchao123/get-insured.git
$ cd get-insured
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

After running npm start, a window should open. If the window doesn't open, type 'localhost:3000'.

## Future Changes
* Add validation to the form inputs when the "Find Lower Rates" button is clicked.
